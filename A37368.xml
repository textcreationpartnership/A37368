            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE Are credibly informed from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> that there hath beene little or no action, theſe three or foure dayes; the 29. of <hi>July</hi> a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter came forth, who reporteth that the Towne is much ſtraitned for want of proviſions, yet ſaith the Souldiers are very cheerefull ſince they heard the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and drinke his health in a cup of cold water, and a very good ſhift too, hoping ere long to have better drink.</p>
            <p>The Councell of Warre agreed to ſhoot in papers with arrowes, to undeceive the Souldiery. The Lord Generall hath ſent ſeverall ſummons to the Town, in one of which he offered, that all private Souldiers &amp; perſons of that rank laying down armes, &amp; enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging not to beare armes any more againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould have liberty and paſſes to go to their ſeverall homes, and there quietly to abide.

            <p> Our forces alſo gave an Alarm to them in <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the great Gunnes plaid round the Leaguer, and the foot with Volleys, in the mean time Colonell <hi>Rainsborough</hi> was acting his deſigne in cutting off a ſluce, to divert the water, and fiering the middle Mill, the firſt tooke good effect, but the ſecond little, the fire not burning above halfe a quarter of an houre, and then extinguiſht, the foot went up to the neck in water to ſtorme the Fort where the Mill was, effected it ſpeedily, with the loſſe of three men, and tenne wounded, beſides one drowned going over the River. The enemy drew down two or three ſmall parties of Horſe, who fac't but durſt not engage, the Souldiers had not time to bring away the priſoners in the Fort, and therefore put them all to the ſword. They within tooke the Alarm hot ſuppoſing a ſtorm, but when they found it otherwiſe, they fired but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, beating their Kettles in ſcorne, and aferwards their D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ums in defiance of them.</p>
            <p>Divers of the Beſiegers being buſied in making of a line through <hi>Maudlin</hi> ſtreete, ſome of the Lord <hi>Capells</hi> Regiment of ſhavers ſallied out of <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Gate upon them, with Piſtolls and Sythes, and our workemen being gotten within Muſquet ſhot of the foreſaid gate; they immediately ſurpriſed three of them, one of which they hewed moſt fearfully with one of their Sythes; the reſt haſting to our guard, were ſudda nly reſcued, and there began a ſhort diſpute betweene them, but our forces fired ſo faſt upon them, that they forced them to retreate, and killed a Gentleman in Scarlet, who wee ſuppoſe to bee ſome eminent Commander.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſide are a cloſing up their line, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108511:4"/>bout Tueſday will have finiſhed it; finiſhed it; which when they have performed, his Excellency may ſpare a conſiderable number of horſe and foot, if there ſhould bee a good occaſion.</p>
            <p>The two demi-Cannon which were lately ſent down were mounted againſt St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and after a few ſhots, brought down a great part of the Steeple, and the Ordnance mounted therein, which falling upon the Leads, brought down moſt of it with them, in which the Ordnance is buried. A party of ours endeavoured to fetch in ſome of their horſe, which grazed neere the Towne walls, but immediately there iſſued forth a party of theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom there began ſome diſpute, wherein was little or no hurt done, but our men retreating the beſiegers had opportunity to remove their horſe, at a farther diſtance, where they remaine with more ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers of this Garriſon are very reſolute and gallant-ſpirited, and not to bee frighted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blaſt of winde, as their actions have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world, there is not ſo great want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion as is reported, for they have plenty of bread &amp; water, with which the Souldiery are very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; and ſo long as that laſteth declare they will never deſiſt the ſervice or leave the Town.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers in <hi>Portſmouth</hi> are much diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Seamen more; being much wrought upon by the Royall party, who have inſtructions from others abroad; the Sea men muſt appeare, and act the deſigne, for which purpoſe about 300 came aſhore, and in the midſt of the Towne declare for King <hi>Charles:</hi> this puts the Governour and the other

            <p>From <hi>Scarborough</hi> wee are certified; that diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and jealouſies of many there, have beene very great, occaſioned by ſome hint of the Governors Treachery, which was ſuſpected many wayes, 1. By turning out Capt. <hi>Lawſon,</hi> a faithfull honeſt man, that long ſerved in that Garriſon. 2. By countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all diſaffected perſons therein, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the reſt. 3. By procuring a ſhip for carying away his malignant Kinſman, and other Cavaliers with him, and giving great entertainment to the Kings Party, with whom hee was very frequent. 4. By expreſſing ſome ill placed words, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a deep conſtruction of his royall affections. The jealouſies are now confirmed by the Governot, Col. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Major Generall encreaſes daily, his number conſiſts of nine thouſand, and with the foot of the Lieutenant Generall with other forces (joyned with him in Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, Leiceſter, and Derby ſhire; which will compleat-5000) his Army will bee very numerous, and more offenſive then defenſive. The Letters ſeized this day in two ſhips bound for Scotland, and brought to the Committee at Derby houſe, will diſcover much Roguery, when reported to morrow to the houſe; the armes are ſeized on, and the ſhips ſecured till further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>order. Lieutenant Generall <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> is to bee for certain to morrow night at Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, from whence hee ſpeedily advances after hee hath joyned with other forces of thoſe parts.
